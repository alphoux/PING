To use the EPIde editor, build the package with 'makepkg' then launch it with './EPIde.sh'.

# Speech synthesis

If you are on a linux-based distro, you need to have festival and speech-dispatcher to use the speech option.
After installation, run 'spd-conf' to init a festival configuration.
Finaly, use './EPIde.sh speech' to run the speech server with the editor.
